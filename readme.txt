Music used:

MAP01:
	"You're Winner" by Lippeth (UltiMIDI Pack)

Intermission:
	"FTW You 100" by Lola Harvey (BlueWorrior) [FreeDooM OST]

Before you ask why I used so much FreeDooM music.. Because it's a fucking jam and a half.. And if you have an issue with that..... uh... shove it up your ugly ass
